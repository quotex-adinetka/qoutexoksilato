## How to Get Started with Quotex

1.  **Create an account:** You can create a demo account or a real
    account. The demo account allows you to practice trading with
    virtual money, while the real account allows you to trade with real
    money.
2.  **Deposit funds:** If you are using a real account, you will need to
    deposit funds into your account. You can do this using a variety of
    methods, including credit cards, debit cards, and wire transfers.
3.  **Choose an asset:** Once you have funded your account, you can
    choose an asset to trade. Quotex offers a wide range of assets,
    including currencies, commodities, and indices. Choose an asset that
    you are familiar with and that you think will move in your favor.
4.  **Select an expiration time:** You will also need to select an
    expiration time for your trade. This is the time at which your trade
    will expire. You can choose an expiration time that ranges from 30
    seconds to 4 hours.
5.  **Predict the price movement:** Once you have selected an asset and
    an expiration time, you will need to predict whether the price of
    the asset will go up or down. You can do this by looking at the
    chart of the asset\'s price history.
6.  **Place your trade:** Once you have made your prediction, you can
    place your trade. You can choose to trade either a call option or a
    put option. A call option is a bet that the price of the asset will
    go up, while a put option is a bet that the price of the asset will
    go down.
